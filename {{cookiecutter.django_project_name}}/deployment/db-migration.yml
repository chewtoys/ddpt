# Migrations need to be performed as a one time job
# every time you change your Django models.

# Why not run migrations in my entrypoint, so everytime we deploy/update
# migrations will be performed?
# - Migrations are a delicate subject, and we want to make sure we have
# the control of our actions, so we can fit the task of running migrations
# in any stage of our deployment, manually or automated by our CD (Continous Delivery/Deployment)

# Run your migrations:
# docker stack deploy --compose-file=docker-stack.django.yml {{cookiecutter.django_project_name}}
# Check if everything went ok:
# docker service logs -f {{cookiecutter.django_project_name}}_django-migrate
