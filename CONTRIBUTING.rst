Getting your pull request merged in
------------------------------------

This is a personal project, but I like to share, and if you want to contribute
just keep in mind I'll need info about what do you want to do.

#. Please, open an issue first and tell me what you want to fix or improve.
#. Keep it small. The smaller the pull request the more likely I'll pull it in.
#. Pull requests that fix a current issue get priority for review.
